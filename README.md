# manifest-template
This repo serves as the central location for manifest templates and the validation rules describing the required data and format for those data within manifests.

Any other repositories or workflows using the manifests or the validation rules should include this repository as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).
