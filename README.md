# manifest-template

This repo serves as the central location for manifest templates and the validation rules describing the required data and format for those data within manifests.

Validation rules are based on the rules established at D3B and used in [their cli](https://github.com/d3b-center/d3b-dff-cli).

Any other repositories or workflows using the manifests or the validation rules should include this repository as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).
